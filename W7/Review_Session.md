## Review Questions

Q1. True or False: You must declare all private members of a class before the public members.

<details>

<summary> Click me to show the answer below!</summary>

False. There is no rule requiring you to declare private members before public members. For example, the `Rectangle` class could be declared as follows:
``` cpp
class Rectangle
{
public:
  void setWidth(double);
  void setLength(double);
  double getWidth() const;
  double getLength() const;
  double getArea() const;
private:
  double width;
  double length;
};
```
In addition, it is not required that all members of the same access specification be declared in the same place. Here is yet another declaration of the `Rectangle` class.
``` cpp
class Rectangle
{
private:
  double width;
public:
  void setWidth(double);
  void setLength(double);
  double getWidth() const;
  double getLength() const;
  double getArea() const;
private:
  double length;
};
```

shows the correct use of the scope resolution operator in the member function definition?

A) `RetailItem::void setPrice(double p)`

Q4.  Assume that `RetailItem` is the name of a class, and the class has a void member function named `setPrice` , which accepts a `double` argument. If `soap` is an
instance of the `RetailItem` class, which of the following statements properly uses the `soap` object to call the `setPrice` member function?

A) `RetailItem::setPrice(1.49);`

B) `soap::setPrice(1.49);`

C) `soap.setPrice(1.49);`

D) `soap:setPrice(1.49);`

Q5. Briefly describe the purpose of a constructor.

<details>

<summary> Click me to show the answer below!</summary>


A constructor is a member function that has the same name as the class. It is automatically called when the object is created in memory, or instantiated. It is helpful to think of constructors as initialization routines. They

Q6. Briefly describe the purpose of a destructor.

<details>

<summary> Click me to show the answer below!</summary>

Destructors are member functions with the same name as the class, preceded by a tilde character (~). For example, the destructor for the `Rectangle` class would be named `~Rectangle`. Destructors are automatically called when an object is destroyed. In the same way that constructors set things up when an object is created, destructors perform shutdown procedures when the object goes out of existence. For example, a common use of destructors is to free memory that was dynamically allocated by the class object.

In addition to the fact that destructors are automatically called when an object is destroyed, the following points should be mentioned:
- Like constructors, destructors have no return type.
- Destructors cannot accept arguments, so they never have a parameter list.

Q7. A member function that is never declared with a return data type, but that may have arguments is

A) The constructor

B) The destructor

C) Both the constructor and the destructor

D) Neither the constructor nor the destructor

A) A number

B) Tilde character ( ~ )

C) A data type name

D) None of the above

Q10. A constructor that requires no arguments is called

A) A default constructor

B) An overloaded constructor

C) A null constructor

D) None of the above


<details>

<summary> Click me to show the answer below!</summary>

A)

When a constructor doesn’t accept arguments, it is known as the `default constructor`. If a constructor has default arguments for all its parameters, it can
be called with no explicit arguments. It then becomes the default constructor. For example, suppose the constructor for the Sale class had been written as the following:
``` cpp
Sale(double cost = 0.0, double rate = 0.05)
{ itemCost = cost;
  taxRate = rate; }
```
This constructor has default arguments for each of its parameters. As a result, the constructor can be called with no arguments, as shown here:
```Sale itemSale;```
This statement defines a `Sale` object. No arguments were passed to the constructor, so the default arguments for both parameters are used. Because this constructor can be called with no arguments, it is the default constructor.

**When all of a class’s constructors require arguments, then the class does not have a default constructor. In such a case you must pass the required arguments to the constructor when creating an object. Otherwise, a compiler error will result.**

Q16. Why would a member function be declared private?

<details>

<summary> Click me to show the answer below!</summary>

Private member function may only be called from a function that is a member of the same class. Sometimes a class will contain one or more member functions that are necessary for internal processing, but should not be called by code outside the class. For example, a class might have a member function that performs a calculation only when a value is stored in a particular member variable and should not be performed at any other time. That function should not be directly accessible by code outside the class because it might get called at the wrong time. In this case, the member function should be declared private . When a member function is declared private , it may only be called internally.

Q17. What is the difference between an instance member variable and a static member variable?

<details>

<summary> Click me to show the answer below!</summary>
When a member variable is declared with the key word static , there will be only one copy of the member variable in memory, regardless of the number of instances of the class that might exist. A single copy of a class’s static member variable is shared by all instances of the class.
</details>

Q18. Static member variables are declared inside the class declaration. Where are static member variables defined?

<details>

<summary> Click me to show the answer below!</summary>

Outside of the class definition. For example,

``` cpp
 // Tree class
class Tree
 {
 private:
  static int objectCount; // Static member variable.
 public:
  // Constructor
  Tree()
  { objectCount++; }
  // Accessor function for objectCount
   int getObjectCount() const
   { return objectCount; }
 };

  // Definition of the static member variable, written
   // outside the class.
   int Tree::objectCount = 0;
```

Q20. Write a class declaration named **Cylinder**  with a private member variable named `radius` and `height` . Write set and get functions to access the `radius` and `height` variables, and a function named `getVolume` that returns the volume of the Cylinder. The volume is calculated as
```
3.14159 * radius * radius * height
```
Use test cases in main function to test your class. 


Q21. Design a `PayRoll` class that has data members for an employee’s hourly pay rate, number of hours worked, and total pay for the week. Write a program with an array of
seven PayRoll objects. The program should ask the user for the number of hours each employee has worked and will then display the amount of gross pay each has earned.

Please conduct Input Validation and do not accept values greater than 60 for the number of hours worked.
